NOTE TO UDACITY REVIEWER:

I am new to front end development. So I'm not sure exactly what needs to be in this ReadME. But here is a list of what I think is relevant:

1) This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
2) I added ReactStrap (Bootstrap v4 for React) because my plan was to jazz the UI up alot more (I'm a Product Designer). But I ran out of time because I was too focused on getting this thing to work the 'React-way' :). I will come back to it. To install ReactStrap: npm install --save reactstrap react-addons-transition-group react-addons-css-transition-group react react-dom
3) I also used Font Awesome but that's off a CDN import so that should affect anything

Looking forward to your feedback!

Thanks
-Tony
