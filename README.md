This is a project I did for the React Nanodegree offered by Udacity. The emphasis was learning how to use React and React-Router. Aesthetics and high quality UX were not the primary focus of this project. 

After downloading or cloning the repository run npm install. Once installed use npm start to launch the project. Access on localhost:3000
